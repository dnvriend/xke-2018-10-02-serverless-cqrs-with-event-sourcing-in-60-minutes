Xebia - XKE 2018-10-02 Serverless CQRS with event sourcing in 60 minutes 

## Subject
Serverless CQRS with event sourcing in 60 minutes in AWS. In a 60 minute live coding session, create a CQRS architected 
serverless backend with views powered by AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, AWS Athena and Quicksight and create 
several views to see the state of an aggregate and view across aggregates.

## Location
The session is at [Xebia](https://xebia.com/), [Laapersveld 27, 1213 VB Hilversum, The Netherlands](https://goo.gl/maps/zcwHWDsXpr92)

## AWS Athena
Based on [Presto](https://github.com/prestodb/presto). Presto supports [JSON](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/functions/json.html) and 
supports [unnest](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/sql/select.html)ing arrays and maps, where an array is expanded into a single 
column and a map is expanded into two colums (key, value).
